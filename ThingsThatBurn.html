        <p class="stories"> <b>1. Hot Water</b></p>
        
        <p class="stories">My t-shirt soaked. Instant noodle oozed on my chest. The neckline of my t-shirt had trapped the sluggish noodles, like a pasta spoon scooping up spaghetti. Some string slid through while some hung around.</p>
            
        <p class=stories>A bowl shattered.</p>
            
        <p class=stories>I maniacally clawed out the boiled noodles and rubbed and rubbed and rubbed.</p>
        
        <p class=stories>“Why did you let your daughter eat <i>Mama</i><sup id="superinbody">1</sup>?”, the paediatrician scorned my mother.</p>
        
        <p class="stories">My mother did not let me eat <i>Mama</i>. I had eaten <i>Mama</i> because my mother had not been there to prevent me. She had not been home that fateful evening and I had been left under the care of my nannies.</p>
        
        <p class="stories">When I was eight, I got to eat certain dishes only when my parents were both not home. Eating <i>Yum Pla Kapong</i><sup id="superinbody">2</sup> when they were at weddings and eating <i>Mama</i> when they were at funerals. Since my parents were rarely absent as a package, getting to eat these dishes was rare golden opportunistic moment.</p>
            
        <p class="stories">That fateful night, I planned to eat <i>Mama</i>.</p>
        
        <p class="stories">Just like with tea, there are different methods in preparing <i>Mama</i>. Most convenient store &mdash; 7-11, Family Mart, visitors use the infusion method: pressing hot water from the hot kettle, letting the noodles sink and steam in its industrial plastic container and its non-recyclable laminated foil cover, and waiting till the noodles soften.</p>
            
        <p class="stories">That night, my nanny used the decoction<sup id="superinbody">3</sup> method.</p>
            
        <p class="stories">Decoction is the ancient Chinese way of making tea. It is to boil the tea &mdash; usually hard barks and herbs, on the stove over time. To bring water to a boil, nowadays, has a specific scientific meaning. The water reaches its boiling point at 100°C or (212°F). In ancient Chinese tea poems, however, the word “boil” was used more broadly and liberally and the temperature of “boiling” water varied.</p>
        
        <p class="stories">Lu Yu 陆羽 (circa 733-804 A.D.), a Tang Dynasty<sup id="superinbody">4</sup> Chinese Tea Master, vividly described three stages of boiling water in his book Chá Jīng 茶经 (Book of Tea, 780 A.D.).</p>
            
        <p class="stories">《茶经》:“其沸如鱼目,微有声为一沸,缘边如涌泉连珠为二沸,腾波鼓浪为三沸,已上水老不可食也。”</p>
            
        <p class="stories">The first sight of fish eyes, accompanied by whimpers is the first stage of boil.<br>
        When the edges turn into gushing springs and strings of pearls, it is the second.<br>
        When the water soared like tumbling drumming waves, it is the third.<sup id="superinbody">5</sup></p>

        <p class="stories">Like wise, Lü Dongbin (circa 796-1016 A.D.) 呂洞賓, a Tang  scholar and poet<sup id="superinbody">6</sup>, described a wave-like boiling water in his poem Dà Yún Sì Chá Shī 大雲寺茶詩 (Tea of Da Yun Temple). However, the waves were not preceded by fish eyes. Instead they were preceded by shrimp eyes.</p>
            
        <p class="stories">《大云寺茶诗》: <br>
            蝦眼湯翻細浪俱 </p>
        <p class="stories">Shrimp eyes current turned <br> entirely into fine waves.</p>
            
        <p class="stories">Later, during the Song dynasty, a calligrapher named Sushi 苏轼 (1037-1101 AD) described another stage of boiling water&mdash; xièyan 蟹眼 crab eyes<sup id="superinbody">7</sup>, in his poem Shì Yuàn Jiānchá 试院煎茶 (Trial Tea).</p>
        
        <p class=stories>《试院煎茶》: <br>
            蟹眼已过鱼眼生 <br>
            飕飕预作松风鸣</p>
        
        <p class=stories>The crab eyes passed. Fish eyes are born. <br>
            Sou Sou, comes the cry of the freed wind.
        </p>
            
        
        <img src="Fisheyes.jpg" alt="SnowStormTurner" style="width:60%;">
            
        <p class=stories>Since the sizes of shrimp eyes and crab eyes are quite close to each other, Shrimp-Eyes-Boiling-Water must be slightly cooler if not the same temperature as Crab-Eyes-Boiling-Water. Based on the poem above and the fact that crab eyes are smaller than fish eyes, Crab-Eyes-Boiling-Water has a lower temperature than that of Fish-Eyes-Boiling-Water. Many ancient Chinese poets agreed and recorded that Crab-Eyes-Boiling-Water is the most suitable temperature of boiling water to use for tea decoction. The water must be kept only at the Crab-Eyes stage.

            Mama มาม่า is a Thai instant noodle brand. Research has found that in Thailand, the sale of Mama goes up toward the end of the month. Toward the end of the month, most people no longer have enough money in their bank accounts to eat proper food. Just kidding, there's no research on this, but there should be.
